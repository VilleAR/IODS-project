# Chapter 2

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*
Lots of catching up, learning how to import files and shape/cut columns to make tables more readable as well as learning how to actually analyze data using mathematical tools like linear regression. Got stuck for about an hour because I didn't realize points was spelled with a small p in the data.

I did do all of the tasks that the week 2 material asked me to do but I didn't really save them since I'm too late to get points for this week anyway. I tested almost all reasonable combinations for single target variables affecting points for fun but found nothing too surprising.
